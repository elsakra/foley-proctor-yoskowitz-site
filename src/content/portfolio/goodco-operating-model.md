We partnered with the executive team to redesign their operating cadence. We introduced a lightweight planning system, a decision log, and a set of metrics that connected strategy to day-to-day execution.

**What changed**

- A single planning rhythm for the full org
- Clear decision mechanisms (who decides, on what timeline)
- A small set of metrics and review loops
